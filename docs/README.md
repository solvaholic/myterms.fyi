# myterms.fyi

## Why is myterms.fyi important?

People do better, for each other and for themselves, when they're aware of what's going on and what's expected of them.

## How do I want myterms.fyi to help with that?

Bring transparency and onymity to anything's terms of use.

Web sites and _I Agree_ buttons usually come with written explanations of what services the provider provides, what they expect of users, and what they intend to do if things go off-script.

I figure pretty much everything people interact with has, or could have, terms like those.

myterms.fyi will help people think about, discover, create, and share their terms and the terms that govern their environments.

## What steps will make that happen?

I'm still learning how to do this. If you'd like to help, please check [the contribution guide](/CONTRIBUTING.html) to see how to engage.
