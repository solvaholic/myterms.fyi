## Why is myterms.fyi important?

People do better, for each other and for themselves, when they're aware of what's going on and what's expected of them.

## How will myterms.fyi to help with that?

Bring transparency and onymity to anything's terms of use.

Web sites and _I Agree_ buttons usually come with written explanations of what services the provider provides, what they expect of users, and what they intend to do if things go off-script.

I figure pretty much everything people interact with has, or could have, terms like those.

myterms.fyi will help people think about, discover, and share the terms that govern their environments.

## What steps will make that happen?

I'm still learning how to do this. If you'd like to help, please check [the contribution guide] to see how to engage.
